gesturemouse
============
Use mouse gestures to open programs.

This code is taken from Example scripts of AutoIt and tweaked a little to work properly.

The script works with the middle-click button at the moment, 
Because middle click is the least used button , hold middleclick and perform gestures like shown in the image (image.png).
Edit the Misc.au3 to add different programs to your gestures

Gestures.exe is just an example to check how the program works, editing Misc.au3 won't affect the exe because it is already compiled.
Gestures.au3 is the actual code.
